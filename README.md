# Popular Posts Viewer (Reddit Integration)

This is a React-based application that fetches and displays popular posts from Reddit. It includes features such as sorting, pagination, displaying user avatars, and showing a fallback image when posts don't have thumbnails.

## Features:
- **Sort Posts**: View posts by different categories like "Hot", "New", "Rising", "Top", etc.
- **Pagination**: Navigate between pages of posts.
- **Post Details**: Displays post title, the number of comments, and share options.
- **User Avatars**: Shows user profile pictures (as small circular images) before usernames.
- **Fallback Images**: For posts that don't have thumbnails, an alternative image is displayed using the first word of the post title.
- **Reddit Links**: Provides clickable links to the original Reddit posts.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: Frontend framework to build the user interface.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for fetching data from Redditâ€™s API.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the UI responsive.
